Changes in openair 0.4-23 [2011-07-15]
=====================================
*	NEW FUNCTION TaylorDiagram for model evaluation.

Changes in openair 0.4-22 [2011-06-03]
=====================================
*	NOTE - use reshape2 in place of reshape for speed and reliability
* 	allow more than one pollutant with percentileRose
* 	fixed title bug with scatterPlot - not shown for some methods
* 	modifed key handling on plots using drawOpenKey, so
  	key = NULL or FALSE now removes colour key.
* 	added method = "level" to scatterPlot for binning data with
	optional smoothing, plus other code clean-ups
* 	fix bug in conditionalQuantile that labelled plots wrongly
	when site(s) has missing data
*	added ref.x and ref.y to timePlot to allow refernce lines to
	be added
* 	do not remove calm wind speed conditions in any functions
	where this is unecessary

Changes in openair 0.4-21 [2011-06-03]
=====================================
* 	fixed bug in polarAnnulus that resulsted in a failure to
	annotate the plot properly with period = "trend" and less than 1 year
	of data; improved smoothing default options used
* 	new 'statistic' option to pollutionRose to show contribution
	to counts and contribution to the mean. The latter is useful for
	displaying those wind directions that make most contribution to teh
	overall mean. Panel mean is also now shown.
* 	small change to final example of re-shaping data in importKCL
* 	timeAverage can now expand data to shorter time periods
	e.g. hourly to 15-minute. This makes it more flexible to combine data
	sets with differeing averging times. For example, daily mean particle
	data can be expanded to 1-hour means and combined with an hourly
	meteorological data set.
* 	Fix treatment of calms in checkPrep, which affected cases with
	zero wind speeds in timeAverage
*	Fix to vector averaging in timeAverage (did not include wind
	speed in calculations). For most data this will make very little
	difference, but will be more important for low wind speeds and/or
	variable wind directions.
* 	allow type = 'variable' in smoothTrend
* 	Add avg.time to smoothTrend for "month" or "year" averages

Changes in openair 0.4-20 [2011-05-31]
=====================================
* 	Do not remove calms in timeAverage
* 	NEW FUNCTION importSAQN to import data from the Scottish Air
	Quality Network

Changes in openair 0.4-19 [2011-05-19]
=====================================
* 	improved import date.name/time.name handling of spaces
* 	Improved scaling for polarFreq
* 	scatterPlot type = "wd" labels aligned
* 	Added option "statistic" to polarPlot, which can now consider
	"mean", "median", "max" (maximum), "frequency". "stdev"
	(standard deviation) or "weighted.mean" in a similar way to polarFreq
* 	Fixed bad.24 and international tz bugs in import
* 	updated import/import.2

Changes in openair 0.4-18 [2011-05-19]
=====================================
*	Better handling of missing data in smoothTrend/MannKendall;
	particularly when there are mutiple sites
*	Do not run checkPreo on selectByDate because it removes calms
*	Fixed scaling bug in polarFreq when ws.int != 1
*	use avg.time in calcPercentile instead of 'period' to ensure
	consistency with other functions (timePlot would fail with
	percentiles)
*	return NA in aqStats when no data present; previously it tried
	to calculate quanities, returning -Inf etc

Changes in openair 0.4-17 [2011-04-21]
=====================================
*	use readRDS and not .readRDS (caused failure on R Dev)
*	openair now depends on >=R2.13.0
*	NEW FUNCTION sqStats to calculate common and pollutant-specfic
	air quality statsitics by year and site.
*	Changed option data.capture in rollingMean to data.thresh to
	be consistent with other functions.

Changes in openair 0.4-16 [2011-04-13]
=====================================
*	Fixed bugs in cutData when a partial year was used with type
  	= "month". Also affected type = "season" and "weekday". The
  	plots were labelled in the wrong order.
*	Ensure that missing wind sectors are skipped in type = "wd"
	for smoothTrend, MannKendall, timePlot and scatterPlot

Changes in openair 0.4-15 [2011-04-12]
=====================================
*	Preparation for CRAN release
*	removed some restrictions on type/period combinations in polarAnnulus

Changes in openair 0.4-14 [2011-04-05]
=====================================
*	Added preliminary greyscale method to openColours and linked in
      strip background and other text and line colour control for
      standard openair plots.

Changes in openair 0.4-13 [2011-03-31]
=====================================
*	Removed ad-hoc sites from importKCL, added site classification
	to the help file and ensured GMT is exported.

Changes in openair 0.4-12 [2011-03-22]
=====================================

*	Added y.relation option to smoothTrend and MannKendall to
         allow flexible y-scales.
*	NEW FUNCTION 'percentileRose' for flexible plotting of
         percentiles by wind direction
*	 NEW FUNCTION 'selectRunning' for selecting run lengths of a numeric
         variable above a certain threshold.
*	Modified plot layout in polarPlot to maximise plotting area
*	Initial fixes to functions affected by time zone settings
*	polarFreq now has consistent annotation cf. windRose and
         percentileRose; new option grid.line to control radial axes.
*	 Fixed couple of minor auto.text bugs in summaryPlot and
         timePlot
*	 Removed dependency of date for polar functions where
         time-based types are not required.


Changes in openair 0.4-11 [2011-03-18]
=====================================

*	More consistent use of strips in default plot (remove them)
*	Add percentage units to windRose and pollutionRose on radial scale

Changes in openair 0.4-10 [2011-03-07]
=====================================

*	Fixed calendarPlot main/quickText handling.
*	Fixed calendarPlot first day of month error.
*	Fixed summaryPlot site ordering when more than one site.

Changes in openair 0.4-9 [2011-03-04]
=====================================

*	Added new options to scatterPlot (plot.type, lwd, and lty)
         making it possible to add points and/or lines


Changes in openair 0.4-8 [2011-02-24]
=====================================

*	Added new cutData type option 'daylight', enabled using new function
	cutDaylight.


Changes in openair 0.4-7 [2011-02-16]
=====================================

*     Added new function conditionalQuantile for model
      evaluation purposes.
*     Fixed importAURN to account for a change in web domain
      address at AEA.
