<h2>Tools for the analysis of air pollution data</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This is a UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)
funded knowledge exchange project that aims to make available innovative
analysis tools for air pollution data.  The tools have generally been
developed to analyse data of at least hourly resolution both for air
pollution monitoring and dispersion modelling. The availability of
meteorological data at the same time resolution greatly enhances the
capabilities of these tools.
</p>
<p>
The project itself is currently funded until October 2011, by which time
the intention is to make <code>openair</code> available on CRAN. Up until that
time the development will carried out on R-Forge
(<a href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/openair/">http://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/openair/</a>).

<p>
<code>openair</code> contains collection of functions to analyse air pollution
data. Typically it is expected that data are hourly means, although some
functions consider other time periods. The principal aim to make
available analysis techniques that most users of air quality data and
model output would not normally have access to. The functions consist of
those developed by the authors and a growing number from other
researchers.
</p>
<p>
Most functions work in a very straightforward way, but offer many
options for finer control and perhaps more in-depth analysis.
</p>
<p>
The <code>openair</code> package depends on several other packages written by
other people to function properly.
</p>
<p>
To ensure that these other packages are available, they need to be
installed, and this requires a connection to the internet. Other
packages required come with the R base system. This can be done by
pasting the text below into R.
</p>
<p>
install.packages(c("zoo", "reshape", "plyr", "RColorBrewer", "Hmisc", "ggplot2"))
</p>
<p>
If there are problems with the automatic download of these packages, see <a href="www.openair-project.org">www.openair-project.org</a> for more details.
</p>
<p>
To check to see if <code>openair</code> has been correctly installed, try some
of the examples below. In case of any problems, contact David Carslaw
