<h2>Bivariate polar plot with smoothing</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Function for
plotting pollutant concentration in polar coordinates showing
concentration by wind speed and direction. Mean concentrations are
calculated for wind speed-direction &lsquo;bins&rsquo; (0-1, 1-2 m/s,... and
0-10, 10-20 degrees etc.).  To aid interpretation, gam smoothing is
carried out using <code>mgcv</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
polar.plot(polar,
pollutant = "nox",
type = "default",
resolution = "normal",
limits = c(0, 100),
exclude.missing = TRUE,
cols = "default",
min.bin = 1,
upper = 10,
force.positive = TRUE,
k = 100, main = "",
auto.text = TRUE, ...)  </pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>polar</code></td>
<td>
A data frame minimally containing <code>ws</code>,
<code>wd</code> and a pollutant. Can also contain <code>date</code> if plots by
time period are required.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pollutant</code></td>
<td>
Mandatory. A pollutant name corresponding to a
variable in a data frame should be supplied e.g. <code>pollutant =
      "nox"</code> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
The type of analysis to be done. The default is will
produce a single plot using the entire data. Other types include
"hour" (for hour of the day), "weekday" (for day of the week) and
"month" (for month of the year), "year" for a polar plot for each
year. There is also an option "site", which requires users to format
their data in the form: <code>date, ws, wd, site</code>.It is also
possible to choose <code>type</code> as another variable in the data
frame. For example, <code>type = "o3"</code> will plot four wind roses
for different levels of ozone, split into four quantiles
(approximately equal numbers of counts in each of the four
splits). This offers great flexibility for understanding the
variation of different variables dependent on another.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>resolution</code></td>
<td>
Two plot resolutions can be set: <code>normal</code> (the
default) and <code>fine</code>, for a smoother plot. It should be noted
that plots with a <code>fine</code> resolution can take longer to render
and the default option should be sufficient or most circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>limits</code></td>
<td>
The functions does its best to choose sensible limits
automatically. However, there are circumstances when the user will
wish to set different ones. An example would be a series of plots
showing each year of data separately. The limits are set in the form
<code>c(lower, upper)</code>, so <code>limits = c(0, 100)</code> would force the
plot limits to span 0-100.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>exclude.missing</code></td>
<td>
Setting this option to <code>TRUE</code> (the
default) removes points from the plot that are too far from the
original data. The smoothing routines will produce predictions at
points where no data exist i.e. they predict. By removing the points
too far from the original data produces a plot where it is clear where
the original data lie. If set to <code>FALSE</code> missing data will be
interpolated.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cols</code></td>
<td>
Colours to be used for plotting. Options include
"default", "increment", "heat", "jet" and user defined. For user
defined the user can supply a list of colour names recognised by R
(type <code>colours()</code> to see the full list). An example would be
<code>cols = c("yellow", "green", "blue")</code></td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>min.bin</code></td>
<td>
The minimum number of points allowed in a wind
speed/wind direction bin.  The default is 1. A value of two requires
at least 2 valid records in each bin (units of 1 m/s and 10 degrees)
an so on; bins with less than 2 valid records are set to NA. Care
should be taken when using a value &gt; 1 because of the risk of removing
real data points. It is recommended to consider your data with
care. Also, the <code><a href="polar.freq.html">polar.freq</a></code> function can be of use in
such circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>upper</code></td>
<td>
This sets the upper limit wind speed to be used. Often
there are only a relatively few data points at very high wind speeds
and plotting all of them can reduce the useful information in the
plot. </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>force.positive</code></td>
<td>
The default is <code>TRUE</code>. Sometimes if
smoothing data with streep gradients it is possible for predicted
values to be negative. <code>force.positive = TRUE</code> ensures that
predictions remain postive. This is useful for several reasons. First,
with lots of missing data more interpolation is needed and this can
result in artefacts because the predictions are too far from the
original data. Second, if it is known beforehand that the data are all
postive, then this option carries that assumption through to the
prediction. The only likley time where setting <code>force.positive =
      FALSE</code> would be if background concentrations were first subtracted
resulting in data that is legitimately negative. For the vast majority
of situations it is expected that the user will not need to alter the
default option.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
This is the smoothing parameter that is set if auto.smooth is
set to <code>FALSE</code>. Typically, value of around 100 (the default)
seems to be suitable and will resolve more features in the plot.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>main</code></td>
<td>
The plot title; default is no title.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>auto.text</code></td>
<td>
Either <code>TRUE</code> (default) or <code>FALSE</code>. If
<code>TRUE</code> titles and axis labels will automatically try and format
pollutant names and units properly e.g.  by subscripting the `2' in
NO2.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
Other graphical parameters.</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The bivariate polar plot is a useful diagnostic tool for
quickly gaining an idea of potential sources. Wind speed is one of the
most useful variables to use to separate source types (see
references). For example, ground-level concentrations resulting from
buoyant plumes from chimney stacks tend to peak under higher wind speed
conditions. Conversely, ground-level, non-buoyant plumes such as from
road traffic, tend to have highest concentrations under low wind speed
conditions. Other sources such as from aircraft engines also show
differing characteristics by wind speed.
</p>
<p>
The plots can vary considerably depending on how much smoothing is
done. The approach adopted here is based on the very flexible and
capable <code>mgcv</code> package that uses <EM>Generalized Additive
Models</EM>. While methods do exist to find an optimum level of
smoothness, they are not necessarily useful. The principal aim of
<code>polar.plot</code> is as a graphical analysis rather than for
quantitative purposes. In this respect the smoothing aims to strike a
balance between interesting (real) features and overly noisy data. The
defaults used in <code>polar.plot</code> are based on the analysis of data
from many different sources. More advanced users may wish to modify
the code and adopt other smoothing approaches.
</p>
<p>
Variants on <code>polar.plot</code> include <code>polar.annulus</code> and
<code>polar.freq</code>.

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>
Some plots can take a long time to produce e.g. if
there are many years of data and <code>type = "year"</code> is chosen. The
function may fail if there are insufficient data to smooth the
surface.
