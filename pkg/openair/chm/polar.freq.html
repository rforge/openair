<h2>Function to plot wind speed/direction frequencies and other statistics</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
<code>polar.freq</code> primarily plots wind speed-direction frequencies in &lsquo;bins&rsquo;. Each bin is colour-coded depending on the frequency of measurements. Bins can also be used to show the concentration of pollutants using a range of commonly used statistics.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
polar.freq(polar,
pollutant = "",
statistic = "frequency",
ws.int = 1,
breaks = seq(0, 5000, 500),
cols = "default",
trans = TRUE,
type = "default",
min.bin = 1,
border.col = "transparent",
main = "",
auto.text = TRUE, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>polar</code></td>
<td>
A data frame minimally containing <code>ws</code>, <code>wd</code> and <code>date</code>.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pollutant</code></td>
<td>
Mandatory. A pollutant name corresponding to a variable in a data frame should be supplied e.g. <code>pollutant = "nox"</code> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>statistic</code></td>
<td>
The statistic that should be applied to each wind speed/direction bin. Can be
"frequency", "mean", "median", "max" (maximum), "stdev" (standard deviation) or
"weighted.mean". The option "frequency" (the default) is the simplest and plots the
frequency of wind speed/direction in different bins. The scale therefore shows the
counts in each bin. The option "mean" will plot the mean concentration of a pollutant
(see next point) in wind speed/direction bins, and so on. Finally, "weighted.mean"
will plot the concentration of a pollutant weighted by wind speed/direction. Each
segment therefore provides the percentage overall contribution to the total concentration.
More information is given in the examples. Note that for options other than
"frequency", it is necessary to also provide the name of a pollutant.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ws.int</code></td>
<td>
Wind speed interval assumed. In some cases e.g. a low met mast, an interval of 0.5 may be more appropriate.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>breaks</code></td>
<td>
The user can provide their own scale. <code>breaks</code> expects a sequence of numbers that define the range of the scale. The sequence could represent one with equal spacing e.g. <code>breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)</code> - a scale from 0-10 in intervals of 10, or a more flexible sequence e.g. <code>breaks = c(0, 1, 5, 7, 10</code>, which may be useful for some situations.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cols</code></td>
<td>
Colours to be used for plotting. Options include "default", "increment", "heat", "jet" and user defined. For user defined the user can supply a list of colour names recognised by R (type <code>colours()</code> to see the full list). An example would be <code>cols = c("yellow", "green", "blue")</code></td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>trans</code></td>
<td>
Should a transformation be applied? Sometimes when producing plots of this kind
they can be dominated by a few high points. The default therefore is <code>TRUE</code> and a
square-root transform is applied. This results in a non-linear scale and (usually) a
better representation of the distribution. If set to <code>FALSE</code> a linear scale is used.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
The type of analysis to be done. The default is will produce a single plot using the
entire data. Other types include "hour" (for hour of the day), "weekday" (for day of
the week), "month" (for month of the year) and "year". Finally, there is an option
"site", which requires a slightly different format. If "site" is used a data frame with headings <code>date</code>, a pollutant and <code>site</code> is required.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>min.bin</code></td>
<td>
The minimum number of points allowed in a wind speed/wind direction bin.  The default is 1. A value of two requires at least 2 valid records in each bin (units of 1 m/s and 10 degrees) an so on; bins with less than 2 valid records are set to NA. Care should be taken when using a value &gt; 1 because of the risk of removing real data points. It is recommended to consider your data with care. Also, the <code><a href="polar.plot.html">polar.plot</a></code> function can be of use in such circumstances.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>border.col</code></td>
<td>
The colour of the boundary of each wind speed/direction bin. The default is
transparent. Another useful choice sometimes is "white".</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>main</code></td>
<td>
Title of plot.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>auto.text</code></td>
<td>
Either <code>TRUE</code> (default) or <code>FALSE</code>. If <code>TRUE</code>
titles and axis labels will automatically try and format pollutant names and units properly e.g.  by subscripting the `2' in NO2.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
Other graphical parameters.</td></tr>
