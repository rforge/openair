<h2>Bivariate polar annulus plot</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Typically plots the concentration of a pollutant by wind direction and as a function of time as an annulus. The function is good for visualising how concentrations of pollutants vary by wind direction and a time period e.g. by month, day of week.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
polar.annulus(polar,
pollutant = "nox",
resolution = "fine",
local.time = FALSE,
period = "hour",
type = "default",
limits = c(0, 100),
cols = "default",
width = "normal",
exclude.missing = TRUE,
date.pad = FALSE,
force.positive = TRUE,
k = 15,
key = TRUE,
main = "",
auto.text = TRUE, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>polar</code></td>
<td>
A data frame minimally containing <code>ws</code>, <code>wd</code> and
a pollutant. Can also contain <code>date</code> if plots by time period are
required.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pollutant</code></td>
<td>
Mandatory. A pollutant or other variable name
corresponding to a variable in a data frame should be supplied
e.g. <code>pollutant = "nox"</code> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>resolution</code></td>
<td>
Two plot resolutions can be set: <code>normal</code> and
<code>fine</code> (the default).</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>local.time</code></td>
<td>
Should the results be calculated in local time? The
default is <code>TRUE</code>. Emissions activity tends to occur at local
time e.g. rush hour is at 8 am every day. When the clocks go forward
in spring, the emissions are effectively released into the
atmosphere at GMT - 1 hour during the summer. When plotting
diurnal profiles, this has the effect of "smearing-out" the
concentrations. A better approach is to express time as local time,
which here is defined as BST (British Summer Time). This correction
tends to produce better-defined diurnal profiles of concentration
(or other variables) and allows a better comparison to be made with
emissions/activity data. If set to <code>FALSE</code> then GMT is used.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>period</code></td>
<td>
This determines the temporal period to consider. Options
are "trend" (the default), "season" to plot variation throughout the
year, "weekday" to plot day of the week variation and "hour" to plot
the diurnal variation.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
The <code>type</code> can either be <code>"default"</code> or
<code>"site"</code>. The former will produce a single plot and the latter
produces the same number of plots as there are sites. See the manual
for details of use. It is also possible to choose <code>type</code> as
another variable in the data frame. For example, <code>type = "o3"</code>
will plot four wind roses for different levels of ozone, split into
four quantiles (approximately equal numbers of counts in each of the
four splits). This offers great flexibility for understanding the
variation of different variables dependent on another.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>limits</code></td>
<td>
The functions does its best to choose sensible limits
automatically. However, there are circumstances when the user will
wish to set different ones. An example would be a series of plots
showing each year of data separately. The limits are set in the form
<code>c(lower, upper)</code>, so <code>limits = c(0, 100)</code> would force the
plot limits to span 0-100.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cols</code></td>
<td>
Colours to be used for plotting. Options include
"default", "increment", "heat", "jet" and user defined. For user
defined the user can supply a list of colour names recognised by R
(type <code>colours()</code> to see the full list). An example would be
<code>cols = c("yellow", "green", "blue")</code></td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>width</code></td>
<td>
The width of the annulus; can be "normal" (the default),
"thin" or "fat".</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>exclude.missing</code></td>
<td>
Setting this option to <code>TRUE</code> (the
default) removes points from the plot that are too far from the
original data. The smoothing routines will produce predictions at
points where no data exist i.e. they predict. By removing the points
too far from the original data produces a plot where it is clear where
the original data lie. If set to <code>FALSE</code> missing data will be
interpolated.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>date.pad</code></td>
<td>
For <code>type = "trend"</code> (default), <code>date.pad =
    TRUE</code> will pad-out missing data to the beginning of the first year and
the end of the last year. The purpose is to ensure that the trend plot
begins and ends at the beginning or end of year.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>force.positive</code></td>
<td>
The default is <code>TRUE</code>. Sometimes if
smoothing data with streep gradients it is possible for predicted
values to be negative. <code>force.positive = TRUE</code> ensures that
predictions remain postive. This is useful for several reasons. First,
with lots of missing data more interpolation is needed and this can
result in artefacts because the predictions are too far from the
original data. Second, if it is known beforehand that the data are all
postive, then this option carries that assumption through to the
prediction. The only likley time where setting <code>force.positive =
    FALSE</code> would be if background concentrations were first subtracted
resulting in data that is legitimately negative. For the vast majority
of situations it is expected that the user will not need to alter the
default option.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
This is the smoothing parameter that is set if auto.smooth is
set to <code>FALSE</code>. Typically, value of around 15 (the default) seems
to be suitable and will resolve more features in the plot. For
<code>type = "trend"</code> <code>k = 20</code> is used to reveal more
detail. Increasing the value of <code>k</code> will decrease the amount of
smoothing, the calculations will take longer. Increasing <code>k</code> for
<code>type</code> other than trend will have little effect. However it can
be useful in trends to show more detail, hence a higher default value
of <code>k</code>. In some cases e.g. a trend plot with less than 1-year of
data the smoothing with the default values may become too noisy and
affected more by outliers. Choosing a lower value of <code>k</code> (say 10)
may help produce a better plot.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>key</code></td>
<td>
Should a key be drawn?</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>main</code></td>
<td>
Title of plot.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>auto.text</code></td>
<td>
Either <code>TRUE</code> (default) or <code>FALSE</code>. If
<code>TRUE</code> titles and axis labels will automatically try and format
pollutant names and units properly e.g.  by subscripting the
&lsquo;2&rsquo; in NO2.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
Other graphical parameters.</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The <code>polar.annulus</code> function shares many of the properties
of the <code>polar.plot</code>. However, <code>polar.annulus</code> is focussed on
displaying information on how concentrations of a pollutant (values of
another variable) vary with wind direction and time. Plotting as an
annulus helps to reduce compression of information towards the centre of
the plot. The circular plot is easy to interpret because wind direction
is most easily understood in polar rather than Cartesian coordinates.
</p>
<p>
The inner part of the annulus represents the earliest time and the
outer part of the annulus the latest time. The time dimension can be
shown in many ways including "trend" (default), "hour" (hour or day),
"season" (month of the year) and "weekday" (day of the week). Taking
hour as an example, the plot will show how concentrations vary by hour
of the day and wind direction. Such plots can be very useful for
understanding how different source influences affect a location.
</p>
<p>
For <code>type = "trend"</code> the amount of smoothing does not vary
linearly with the length of the time series i.e. a certain amount of
smoothing per unit interval in time. This is a deliberate choice because
should one be interested in a subset (in time) of data, more detail will
be provided for the subset compared with the full data set. This allows
users to investigate specific periods in morte detail. Full flexibility
is given through the smoothing parameter <code>k</code>.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>
The function is written mostly for more than 1-year
of hourly data. If less than 1-year of data are used and <code>type =
"trend"</code> then <code>type = "season"</code> will be used, which should have the
desired effect. Setting <code>k</code> too high may result in an error if
there are insufficient data to justify such detailed
smoothing. Calculations will take longer as <code>k</code> increases.
