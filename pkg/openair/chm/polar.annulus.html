<h2>Bivariate polar annulus plot</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Typically plots the concentration of a pollutant by wind direction and as a function of time as an annulus. The function is good for visualising how concentrations of pollutants vary by wind direction and a time period e.g. by month, day of week.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
polar.annulus(polar,
pollutant = "",
resolution = "fine",
local.time = TRUE,
type = "trend",
limits = c(0, 100),
cols = "default",
width = "normal",
auto.smooth = FALSE,
k = 15, key = TRUE,
main = "",
auto.text = TRUE, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>polar</code></td>
<td>
A data frame minimally containing <code>ws</code>, <code>wd</code> and  a pollutant. Can also contain <code>date</code> if plots by time period are required.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pollutant</code></td>
<td>
Mandatory. A pollutant or other variable name corresponding to a variable in a data frame should be supplied e.g. <code>pollutant = "nox"</code> </td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>resolution</code></td>
<td>
Two plot resolutions can be set: <code>normal</code> and <code>fine</code> (the default).</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>local.time</code></td>
<td>
Should the results be calculated in local time? The default is <code>TRUE</code>. Emissions activity tends to occur at local time e.g. rush hour is at 8 am every day. When the
clocks go forward in spring, the emissions are effectively released into the atmosphere
at GMT – 1 hour during the summer. When plotting diurnal profiles, this has the
effect of "smearing-out" the concentrations. A better approach is to express time as
local time, which here is defined as BST (British Summer Time). This correction
tends to produce better-defined diurnal profiles of concentration (or other variables)
and allows a better comparison to be made with emissions/activity data. If set to <code>FALSE</code> then GMT is used.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
This determines the temporal period to consider. Options are "trend" (the default),
"season" to plot variation throughout the year, "weekday" to plot day of the week
variation and "hour" to plot the diurnal variation.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>limits</code></td>
<td>
The functions does its best to choose sensible limits automatically. However, there are circumstances when the user will wish to set different ones. An example would
be a series of plots showing each year of data separately. The limits are set in the form <code>c(lower, upper)</code>, so <code>limits = c(0, 100)</code> would force the plot limits to span 0–100.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cols</code></td>
<td>
Colours to be used for plotting. Options include "default", "increment", "heat", "jet" and user defined. For user defined the user can supply a list of colour names recognised by R (type <code>colours()</code> to see the full list). An example would be <code>cols = c("yellow", "green", "blue")</code></td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>width</code></td>
<td>
The width of the annulus; can be "normal" (the default), "thin" or "fat".</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>auto.smooth</code></td>
<td>
Should smoothing be automatically controlled? The default is <code>FALSE</code>. When set to <code>TRUE</code>, this means that the GAM smoothing tries to find the best fit to the surface i.e. a compromise between a surface that is too noisy and too smooth. See <code>mgcv</code> for more details. On most occasions it is probably better to set it to FALSE and set the smooth parameter <code>k</code> separately; see next option.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
This is the smoothing parameter that is set if auto.smooth is set to <code>FALSE</code>. Typically, value of around 15 (the default) seems to be suitable and will resolve more features in the plot.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>exclude.missing</code></td>
<td>
Setting this option to <code>TRUE</code> (the default) removes points from the plot that are too far from the original data. The smoothing routines will produce predictions at points where no data exist i.e. they predict. By removing the points too far from the original data produces a plot where it is clear where the original  data lie. If set to <code>FALSE</code> missing data will be interpolated.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>key</code></td>
<td>
Should a key be drawn?</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>main</code></td>
<td>
Title of plot.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>auto.text</code></td>
<td>
Either <code>TRUE</code> (default) or <code>FALSE</code>. If <code>TRUE</code>
titles and axis labels will automatically try and format pollutant names and units properly e.g.  by subscripting the &lsquo;2&rsquo; in NO2.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
Other graphical parameters.</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The <code>polar.annulus</code> function shares many of the properties of the <code>polar.plot</code>. However, <code>polar.annulus</code> is focussed on displaying information on how concentrations of a pollutant (values of another variable) vary with wind direction and time. Plotting as an annulus helps to reduce compression of information towards the centre of the plot. The circular plot is easy to interpret because wind direction is most easily understood in polar rather than cartesian coordinates.
</p>
<p>
The inner part of the annulus represents the earliest time and the outer part of the annulus the latest time. The time dimension can be shown in many ways including "trend" (default), "hour" (hour or day), "season" (month of the year) and "weekday" (day of the week). Taking hour as an example, the plot will show how concentrations vary by hour of the day and wind direction. Such plots can be very useful for understanding how different source influences affect a location.
