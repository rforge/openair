<h2>Estimate NO2/NOX emission ratios from monitoring data</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Given hourly NOX and NO2 from a roadside site and hourly NOX,
NO2 and O3 from a background site the function will estimate the
emissions ratio of NO2/NOX &mdash; the level of primary NO2
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
calc.fno2(input,
tau = 60,
plot = TRUE,
user.fno2,
main = "",
theme = "bw",
...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>input</code></td>
<td>
A data frame with the following fields. <code>nox</code>
and<code>no2</code> (roadside NOX and NO2 concentrations),
<code>backnox</code>, <code>backno2</code> and <code>backo3</code> (hourly
background concentrations of each pollutant). In addition
<code>temp</code> (temperature in degrees Celsius) and <code>cl</code> (cloud
cover in Oktas). Note that if <code>temp</code> and <code>cl</code> are not
available, typical means values of 11 deg. C and cloud = 3.5 will be
used.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tau</code></td>
<td>
Mixing time scale. It is unlikely the user will need to
adjust this. See details below.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
Should a plot be produced? The default is <code>TRUE</code> and
will plot the trend in f-NO2 as a monthly time series.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>user.fno2</code></td>
<td>
User-supplied f-NO2 fraction e.g. 0.1 is a
NO2/NOX ratio of 10% by volume. <code>user.no2</code> will be
applied to the whole time series and is useful for testing "what if"
questions.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>main</code></td>
<td>
Title of plot if required.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>theme</code></td>
<td>
Colour theme to use - see ggplot2 for details. Can be
<code>"bw"</code> (default) or <code>"grey"</code>.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
Other graphical parameters.</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The principal purpose of this function is to estimate the
level of primary (or direct) NO2 from road vehicles. When hourly data
of NOX, NO2 and O3 are available, the total oxidant method of Clapp and
Jenkin (2001) can be used. If roadside O3 measurements are available
see <code><a href="linear.relation.html">linear.relation</a></code> for details of how to estimate the
primary NO2 fraction.
</p>
<p>
In the absence of roadside O3 measurements, it is rather more
problematic to calculate the fraction of primary NO2. Carslaw and
Beevers (2005c) developed an approach based on
<code><a href="linear.relation.html">linear.relation</a></code> the analysis of roadside
and background measurements. The increment in roadside NO2
concentrations is primarily determined by direct emissions of NO2 and
the availability of One to react with NO to form NO2. The method aims
to quantify the amount of NO2 formed through these two processes by
seeking the optimum level of primary NO2 that gives the least error.
</p>

</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>
<code>calc.fno2</code> works best when the roadside signal
is strong i.e. when roadside concentrations are in clear excess of
background concentrations. When there is little difference between
roadside and background concentrations it is difficult for the method
to distinguish between the NO2 from direct emissions and that formed
through the reaction with NO and One.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it can be useful to filter by wind direction (and maybe wind
speed) to ensure that the conditions where the contribution from the
road is prominent are selected. The <code><a href="polar.plot.html">polar.plot</a></code> function
can be useful for filtering the data in this way.
